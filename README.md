# AKG Retro Games — windows

PRIVATE, INCOMPLETE FOUNDATION. This repository contains the selected menu concept, an original icon, and tested update-manifest validation helpers. It does not yet contain a playable frontend, ROMs, signing keys, a published update feed, release packages, verified cheats, or stage selection. The menu image is a mockup and its titles are illustrative.

Future updates are intended to use an externally hosted distribution service; no developer token may be embedded in the client. SHA-256 alone does not authenticate a catalog: a trusted signed manifest or equivalent trust mechanism is still required before shipping. Android package signing is separate from update metadata signing.

Developer attribution and disclaimer: [NOTICE.md](NOTICE.md). Platform icon assets are in `assets/platform-icons/`; application integration is not yet implemented.

## Engine foundation
The experimental engine registry is pinned to `midoali250/bitvault-engine` commit `4eb0473490357c1fc8b8d86af4e4f794632b9746` on `engine/clean-foundation`. NES and SNES use the registry's FCEUmm and Snes9x revisions. The engine registry is a build-probe foundation, not a finished cross-platform player. No ROMs are bundled.
