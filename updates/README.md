# Independent signed windows update channel

The application checks the latest **non-prerelease** release in
`midoali250/akg-retro-games-windows` for `akg-update-manifest.json`. The signed manifest
must match this product, platform, pinned Ed25519 public key, and a newer
integer version. Downloads are size- and SHA-256-verified; no GitHub token or
private signing key is embedded in the application.

After verification, the desktop client downloads into Downloads/AKG-Retro-Games-Updates. The user must open or replace the application manually; automatic installation is not yet implemented.

## Publishing an update

1. Increase `updates/version.json` to the new integer version **before** the
   package is built; it must be greater than the installed version.
2. Build and test the correct platform package. For Android, use the dedicated
   release-signed APK (not a debug APK) with the same application ID and key.
3. Create a **draft** GitHub Release with tag `vN` (where N is the version
   code), upload the single appropriate platform asset, then publish it as a
   normal release, not a prerelease.
4. The `Sign platform release updates` workflow hashes that asset, signs the
   manifest using this repository's `AKG_UPDATE_SIGNING_SEED` secret and
   uploads it. It refuses to overwrite an existing manifest. Check that the
   workflow succeeded before expecting the app to detect the update.
   If the release was published by a workflow using `GITHUB_TOKEN`, GitHub
   may suppress release-triggered workflows; run `Sign platform release
   updates` manually for the tag and version instead.

The private update signing seed is stored as an Actions secret; its separate
backup is in the shared engine's Actions secrets. Android also has a distinct
APK-signing identity and backup. Do not rotate/delete these without a tested
migration and secure backup. `public-key.json` is intentionally public.

No complete old-build-to-new-build GitHub release update has yet been verified
end to end. Older preview packages may lack this updater. The historic
`channel.template.json` is an inactive template and is not this channel.
